# mini-complier-with-c
The Mini Compiler in C reads C-like code and performs lexical analysis to identify keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and symbols. It tokenizes the input, detects basic syntax patterns, and displays tokens in a structured format. This project teaches parsing, string handling, arrays, and file I/O.
